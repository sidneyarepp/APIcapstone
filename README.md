## What it does

The NFL team information app allows you to access the team website link, social media links, and next five games for your favorite team without having to miss out on live scores.

## How it works

### Choose your favorite team
When you arrive on the site you will see a simple drop down menu allowing you to select your favorite team.  Choose your team from the dropdown, click the "submit" button, and all of the information on your team, as well as live scores for the current week, will show for you.
